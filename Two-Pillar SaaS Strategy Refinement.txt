Unofficial Communities: Two-Pillar SaaS Architecture Strategy Refinement
Status: Strategic Architecture Review
Date: January 28, 2026
Prepared for: Lead Systems Architect
Audience: Product, Engineering, Business Leadership
________________________________________
Executive Summary
Your SaaS platform is built on a powerful dual-core model that separates Social Intelligence (engagement) from Commercial Optimization (conversion). This strategy refinement addresses three critical questions:
1.	Pillar 1: How to map social density and identify high-potential users without disrupting social experience
2.	Pillar 2: How to design AI-driven user qualification and automated showroom improvement loops
3.	The Bridge: How to transition users at the optimal moment without friction or manipulation
This document provides:
•	Operational science frameworks grounded in your Graph Theory and Behavioral Science research
•	Specific technical architectures for both pillars and the bridge
•	Guardrails and ethical constraints to prevent manipulation while maximizing conversion
•	Metrics and feedback loops for continuous improvement
________________________________________
Part 1: Understanding Your Current Architecture
Pillar 1: The Social Engagement Ecosystem (UC World 3D)
Purpose: Build belonging, autonomy, and competence through ethical gamification and spatial presence.
Core Mechanisms (from your docs):
•	Living Graph: Community-to-community proximity mapping (affinity, member overlap, co-activity patterns)
•	Proxemics: Zone-based density management (Hub, Lounges, Workshop, Quiet, Onboarding, Brand)
•	Behavioral Layers: Fogg MAP + SDT (Self-Determination Theory) as mandatory system constraints
•	Ethical Enforcement: Data minimization, anti-dark patterns, circuit breakers, k-anonymity
Current State:
•	26 satellite communities ready for launch
•	Living Graph daily aggregation job producing community-level features (no PII)
•	Portal system connecting communities with explainability (reason codes)
•	Dunbar-led size constraints (50–500 members optimal, hard cap 500)
Social Intelligence Generated:
•	Community activity signals (active members, sessions, dwell time)
•	Zone patterns (where people congregate, where they retreat)
•	Cross-community flow (travel rates, bounce rates, diversity of visits)
•	Behavioral signatures (mission completion, social reciprocity)
Pillar 2: The Conversion Ecosystem (Virtual Showrooms)
Status: Planned but not yet operationalized.
Purpose: Convert high-intent users into qualified leads or sales using signals from Pillar 1 with ethical qualification and automated improvement.
Gap Identified: Your current architecture has the data foundation (Living Graph, behavioral tokens) but lacks:
1.	A purchase intent detection model that translates social signals to conversion readiness
2.	An AI bot feedback loop for real-time qualification and gating
3.	An automated improvement system that learns from showroom performance and optimizes layout/data-requests
The Bridge: Transition Mechanics
Status: Conceptual.
Goal: Identify the exact moment when a user transitions from "high engagement" to "high purchase intent" and route them to a showroom without:
•	Manipulation or coercion
•	Breaking their social experience
•	Reducing trust in the platform

Part 2: Pillar 1 Refined – Mapping Social Density & Identifying High-Potential Users
2.1 Social Density & Graph Theory: Operational Framework
Your research (Estudo 028, 029, 030) establishes that Graph Theory enables auditible, interpretable proximity mapping. Here's how to operationalize it to identify high-potential users without surveillance:
A. Three-Layer Graph Model (Already Conceptually Sound)
Layer	Entities	Purpose	Guardrail
Interest Graph	Users → Content/Tags/Zones/Events	Cold-start discovery, interest matching	Minimize behavioral inference; prefer explicit signals (zone visits, mission types)
Social Graph	Users → Recurring co-presences, co-participation	Belonging, trust, reciprocity	Store aggregates only, no dyadic edges at individual level
Community Graph	Communities → Communities (6-neighbor portal system)	Cross-community health, discovery, partnerships	Aggregate signals; never expose individual member names or IDs

Application to High-Potential User Identification:
Instead of profiling individual users (which violates privacy and ethics), use community-level and cohort-level signals to identify which communities generate high-potential leads, then route qualified users into Pillar 2.
B. High-Potential User Signals (Community & Cohort Level)
Define "high-potential" not as "most likely to buy" but as "demonstrates intent + engaged + low risk." This requires two layers:
Layer 1: Behavioral Intent Signals (Derived from Pillar 1)
Signal	Data Source	Interpretation	Calculation
Mission Velocity	missionactivitydaily aggregates	User completes assigned missions (earning XP) → demonstrates autonomy, competence	Cohort-level: % of active users completing ≥5 missions in rolling 7d
Zone Diversity	zonedwelldaily (multiple zones visited)	User explores beyond central hub → indicates curiosity, openness	Per user: unique_zones_visited / total_zones in 7d window
Social Reciprocity	Implied via co-presence + lounge usage	User enters lounges (semi-private bonding spaces) → signals social bonding, trust	Community-level: % of users with ≥2 lounge sessions in 7d
Brand Zone Opt-in	Portal/zone entry events (with consent)	User voluntarily enters partner spaces → signals openness to value exchange	Opt-in conversions: explicit click to enter brand zone
Session Persistence	whatsappactivitydaily + world.presence events	Cross-channel engagement (WhatsApp + 3D world) → signals committed participation	Cohort: D7 (% active 7 days after signup) and repeat 3d+ activity
Conversation Quality	WhatsApp sentiment (only if opt-in, aggregated)	Long-form responses, not just reactions → depth of engagement	Optional future: aggregate sentiment score by community (not individual)

Key Principle: All signals are cohort-aggregated and community-level, never individual-level profiling. This respects privacy while identifying which communities produce high-intent users.
C. Community-Level Readiness for Conversion Bridge
Define communities that are "healthy + high-intent" as candidates for Pillar 2 bridge activation:
Community Readiness Score (Composite, Quarterly Recalibration)
ReadinessScore = (0.3 × EngagementHealth)
+ (0.3 × SocialHealth)
+ (0.2 × IntentSignals)
+ (0.2 × SafetyCompliance)
Where:
•	EngagementHealth = D7_retention × mission_completion_rate × avg_session_persistence
•	SocialHealth = entropy_social × reciprocity_proxy × zone_diversity
•	IntentSignals = brand_zone_opt_in_rate × cross_community_travel × lounge_utilization
•	SafetyCompliance = moderation_response_time × report_rate_inverse × leader_stability
Decision Rule:
•	Tier 1 (Green): ReadinessScore ≥ 0.75 → Eligible for conversion bridge
•	Tier 2 (Yellow): 0.50–0.74 → Observe for 2 weeks, then re-evaluate
•	Tier 3 (Red): < 0.50 → Not ready; continue engagement-only
D. Anonymized User Cohort Identification
For users within Tier 1 communities, define behaviorally-similar cohorts without identifying individuals:
Example Cohort: "High-Intent Explorers"
Criteria (all community + cohort level):
•	Member of Tier 1 community
•	Zone diversity ≥ 4 unique zones in 7d
•	Mission completion rate ≥ 60%
•	Brand zone opt-in: Yes (explicit consent)
•	D7 retention: Yes
•	Social reciprocity: ≥ 2 lounge sessions
•	No safety flags (reports, bans, violations)
Output: "This community has 45 users in the High-Intent Explorer cohort."
NO individual names, IDs, or behavioral profiles sent to Pillar 2.
2.2 Operationalization: Living Graph Extensions for Conversion Readiness
New Aggregates Required (Add to 07_EVENT_AND_ANALYTICS_SPEC.md):
Aggregate	Window	Dimensions	Metrics	Purpose
intentreadinessdaily	1 day	communityid, cohorttype	mission_completion_rate, zone_diversity_avg, brand_optins, social_reciprocity_pct	Hourly readiness assessment
cohortmembership	1 day	communityid, cohorttype	count_users, avg_engagement_score	Cohort population tracking
communityreadinesstrends	7 days	communityid	readiness_score, trend_direction, stability	Weekly readiness forecasting

New Daily Job: intentReadinessBuild (Add to 08_BACKGROUND_JOBS)
Schedule: 0600 BRT (after all daily aggregates complete)
Inputs: analyticsaggregates (missionactivity, zone dwell, brand zone, portal activity, whatsapp activity)
Process:
1.	Compute per-cohort aggregate metrics across all Tier 1 communities
2.	Calculate community readiness scores
3.	Identify new cohorts meeting High-Intent Explorer (or custom) criteria
4.	Log cohort population and characteristics (aggregated)
5.	Output: cohortmembership table + readiness_score + unsafe to query for individual data
API Contract (New Endpoint for Pillar 2):
GET /api/v1/conversion/community-readiness
Query params: communityIds[], minReadinessScore=0.75
Response:
{
"communities": [
{
"communityId": 5,
"readinessScore": 0.82,
"readinessTier": "green",
"eligibilityReason": "High engagement, strong social health, opt-in brand exposure",
"cohorts": [
{
"cohortType": "high-intent-explorers",
"cohortSize": 45,
"behavioralProfile": {
"avg_zone_diversity": 4.2,
"mission_completion_pct": 65,
"brand_zone_optins": 0.91,
"social_reciprocity_pct": 0.78
}
}
],
"recommendedAction": "ELIGIBLE_FOR_BRIDGE",
"lastUpdated": "2026-01-28T06:15:00Z"
}
]
}
Critical Guardrails:
1.	No individual-level data in response (only aggregates and cohort counts)
2.	Reason codes explain readiness (transparency)
3.	Explicit opt-in for brand zone = precondition for bridge eligibility
4.	Community leader approval required before bridge activation (governance gate)
________________________________________
Part 3: Pillar 2 Refined – Virtual Showrooms & AI-Driven Qualification
3.1 Purchase Intent Detection Model
Problem: How do you identify which users from a high-readiness community are ready to convert without individual profiling?
Answer: Use cohort-level behavioral patterns + explicit intent signals + AI-driven real-time gating.
A. Intent Classification Framework
Define four intent stages (not individual user labels, but aggregate cohort behaviors):
Intent Stage	Signal Composition	System Action
Latent	Engaged but no explicit brand interaction	Social engagement only; no showroom access
Exploratory	Zone diversity ≥4, brand zone opt-in, ≥2 return visits	Eligible for Tier 1 Showroom (low-friction exploration)
Qualitative	Exploratory + sustained ≥7d engagement + 2+ brand zone visits	Eligible for Tier 2 Showroom (consultative, AI-assisted)
Transactional	Qualitative + explicit action (link click, form start, FAQ view)	Eligible for Tier 3 Showroom (high-friction, sales-optimized)

Key Design:
•	No individual scoring. Instead, route cohorts (not persons) into stages based on aggregated metrics.
•	Behavioral triggers (e.g., "click form button") move a user from Qualitative to Transactional within a session.
•	Decay: Intent signals expire if behavior drops (7d inactivity reverts user to Latent).
B. AI Bot Feedback Loop: Real-Time Qualification
Design a conversational AI concierge that operates in showrooms with explicit guardrails:
Bot Architecture:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User Enters Showroom (Tier 1, 2, or 3) │
└────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┘

Event: qa_intent Event: tx_intent
Bot logs: time, Bot logs: time,

Bot Decision Tree (Pseudo-code):
function routeUserToShowroom(userId, cohortStage, showroomVariant) {
// 1. Determine bot mode based on cohort
if (cohortStage === 'exploratory') {
botMode = 'educational'
allowHardSell = false
dataCollectionIntensity = 'minimal'
} else if (cohortStage === 'qualitative') {
botMode = 'consultative'
allowHardSell = false
dataCollectionIntensity = 'moderate'
} else if (cohortStage === 'transactional') {
botMode = 'sales-oriented'
allowHardSell = true
dataCollectionIntensity = 'full'
}
// 2. Initialize session with transparency
botMessages = [
"Olá! Sou um assistente IA. Você pode sair a qualquer momento.",
"Estou aqui para ajudar você a entender se isso é certo para você.",
"Como você chegou aqui hoje?"
]
// 3. Qualify via conversation
while (sessionActive) {
userInput = captureUserResponse()
// Log interaction (aggregated)
logInteraction({
  eventType: 'bot_interaction',
  botMode: botMode,
  questionAsked: botCurrentQuestion,
  answerProvided: userInput,
  userEngagement: scoreEngagement(userInput),
  intentSignal: extractIntentSignal(userInput)
})

// Decide next bot action
if (userSignalsReadiness()) {
  // Move to lead capture form (but not mandatory)
  offerOptionalLeadCapture()
} else if (userAsksToLeave()) {
  recordExit({
    reason: 'user-initiated',
    dwell_seconds: sessionDuration,
    intent_change: finalIntentScore - initialIntentScore
  })
  exit()
} else if (sessionTimeout > 15min) {
  recordExit({
    reason: 'timeout',
    intent_change: ...
  })
  exit()
}

}
}
Bot Qualification Metrics (Real-Time Logging):
Metric	Definition	Use
question_count	Questions asked by user	Curiosity proxy
answer_depth	Character count of bot answers / user questions	Engagement depth
intent_signal_strength	Keyword extraction: "pricing", "timeline", "team", etc.	Intent classification
ui_interaction_count	CTA clicks, form field focuses, carousel swipes	Explicit intent
dwell_time_sec	Time in showroom	Consideration depth
lead_quality_score	Composite (1–10): intent_strength + engagement_depth + fit_indicators	Downstream CRM routing

3.2 Automated Improvement System: Showroom Feedback Loops
Problem: How do you continuously optimize showroom layout, data requests, and bot prompts based on real user behavior without A/B testing every variant?
Answer: Build a closed-loop analytics system where showroom performance metrics directly inform design updates.
A. Showroom Performance Metrics (Daily Aggregation)
New job: showroomPerformanceBuild (add to 08_BACKGROUND_JOBS)
Schedule: 0800 BRT (after bot interactions logged)
-- Per-showroom, per-day metrics
CREATE TABLE showroomperformancedaily (
id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
periodstart DATE NOT NULL,
showroom_id INT NOT NULL,
variant_id VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., "layout-v1", "bot-prompt-v2"
-- Funnel metrics
entrance_count INT,
form_start_count INT,
form_completion_count INT,
lead_capture_count INT,
-- Engagement metrics
avg_dwell_sec DECIMAL(8,2),
question_count_total INT,
question_count_avg DECIMAL(6,2),
bot_interaction_count_total INT,
-- Behavior metrics
exit_type_distribution JSON, -- {user_initiated: 20, timeout: 5, ...}
intent_signal_strength_avg DECIMAL(5,2),
-- Quality metrics
avg_lead_quality_score DECIMAL(5,2),
intent_improvement_pct DECIMAL(6,2), -- (final_score - initial_score) / initial_score
-- Friction metrics
form_abandon_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
bot_fallback_count INT, -- User said "I want to talk to a human"
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
UNIQUE KEY uk_showroom_date (showroom_id, periodstart, variant_id)
);
B. Feedback Loop Rules (Automated Optimization)
Rule 1: Layout Adjustment
IF avg_dwell_sec < 90 THEN
-- Users exiting too quickly; layout may be confusing
Action: Increase visual hierarchy of CTA buttons
IF form_start_count / entrance_count < 0.1 THEN
-- Poor visibility
Move CTA above the fold
END IF
Priority: High
A/B Test: Current layout vs. simplified layout
Duration: 7 days
Success Criterion: avg_dwell_sec increases by ≥15%
END IF
Rule 2: Bot Prompt Adjustment
IF intent_signal_strength_avg < 0.5 THEN
-- Users not expressing clear intent
Action: Change bot opening question from generic to specific
Current: "Como você chegou aqui?"
Proposed: "Qual é seu maior desafio com [product area]?"
A/B Test: Current prompt vs. specific prompt
Measurement: intent_signal_strength_avg, conversation length
Duration: 7 days
END IF
Rule 3: Data Request Optimization
IF form_abandon_rate > 0.4 THEN
-- Users dropping out during form
Action: Reduce required fields
Current: 7 fields (name, email, company, role, budget, timeline, needs)
Proposed: 3 fields (name, email, one of: budget OR timeline)
Test: Run for 7 days
Metric: form_completion_count, lead_quality_score (should not decrease)
END IF
Rule 4: Variant Selection (Winner Selection)
FOR EACH showroom_id:
winner_variant = SELECT variant_id
FROM showroomperformancedaily
WHERE periodstart >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
ORDER BY lead_quality_score DESC, form_completion_count DESC
LIMIT 1
-- Roll out to all new sessions
UPDATE showrooms
SET active_variant_id = winner_variant
WHERE id = showroom_id
END FOR
C. Showroom Configuration Schema
CREATE TABLE showroomlayouts (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
showroom_id INT NOT NULL,
variant_id VARCHAR(50),
-- Layout configuration
hero_headline TEXT,
hero_subheadline TEXT,
cta_button_text VARCHAR(100),
cta_button_position ENUM('above_fold', 'middle', 'bottom'),
-- Form configuration
form_fields JSON, -- [{name: "email", required: true}, ...]
form_submit_text VARCHAR(100),
form_privacy_text TEXT,
-- Bot configuration
bot_opening_prompt TEXT,
bot_mode ENUM('educational', 'consultative', 'sales_oriented'),
bot_allowed_hard_sell BOOLEAN,
bot_fallback_text TEXT,
-- Data collection
data_collection_intensity ENUM('minimal', 'moderate', 'full'),
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
FOREIGN KEY (showroom_id) REFERENCES showrooms(id)
);
CREATE TABLE showroombottests (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
showroom_id INT NOT NULL,
test_variant_id VARCHAR(50),
control_variant_id VARCHAR(50),
-- Test control
start_date DATE NOT NULL,
end_date DATE,
status ENUM('active', 'completed', 'paused'),
-- Winner
winner_variant_id VARCHAR(50),
winning_metric DECIMAL(8,2),
created_at TIMESTAMP,
FOREIGN KEY (showroom_id) REFERENCES showrooms(id)
);
3.3 Purchase Intent Model: Decision Tree
Define: Which users move from Pillar 1 → Pillar 2 conversion showroom?
Non-Manipulative Route:
1.	Explicit Opt-in (Primary Signal):
o	User clicks "Learn more" or enters Brand Zone in Pillar 1 = passive interest signal
o	User clicks "I'm interested in a consultation" = active intent signal
o	System action: Route to Tier 2 Showroom (consultative mode)
2.	Algorithmic Suggestion (Secondary Signal):
o	Only for users in "Qualitative" cohort (high engagement + brand zone opt-in + 7d+ retention)
o	Suggestion: "Based on your activity, you might be interested in [product]" (no manipulation)
o	User can accept or dismiss (one-click, reversible)
o	System action: Route to Tier 2 Showroom if accepted
3.	Behavioral Trigger (Tertiary Signal):
o	User visits Brand Zone 3+ times in 7 days = repeated interest signal
o	System can proactively suggest showroom (not push)
o	System action: Optional: Display light banner "Explore showroom?" (opt-out available)
Decision Logic:
function determineShowroomEligibility(userId) {
cohort = getCohort(userId)
// Explicit signals (always honor)
if (user.intentSignal === 'explicit_click') {
return 'tier_2_showroom'
}
// Behavioral signals (only for high-engagement cohorts)
if (cohort.stage === 'qualitative'
&& user.brandZoneVisits >= 3
&& user.d7Retention === true) {
// Don't auto-route; offer as suggestion
return 'suggestion_eligible'

}
// Default: stay in engagement ecosystem
return 'engagement_only'
}
________________________________________
Part 4: The Bridge – Transition Mechanics
4.1 The Moment of Transition
Goal: Identify the precise moment when a user moves from "high social engagement" to "high purchase intent" and route them without friction or manipulation.
Key Insight: Don't force the moment. Let users self-select via explicit actions, then use behavioral data to confirm readiness.
4.2 Three-Phase Bridge Architecture
Phase 1: Signal Accumulation (Pillar 1 → Awareness)
User in high-readiness community does one or more of:
•	Completes 5+ missions in 7 days
•	Visits 4+ unique zones
•	Enters Brand Zone (explicit opt-in)
•	Stays in community ≥7 days
•	Participates in social interactions (lounges, workshops)
System state: User accumulates intent signals in Pillar 1. No redirection yet.
Phase 2: Readiness Detection (Analytics Job)
Daily job intentReadinessBuild detects user meets "Qualitative" cohort criteria:
User qualifies if:
✓ Community readiness score ≥ 0.75
✓ User mission completion ≥ 60%
✓ Zone diversity ≥ 4 unique zones in 7d
✓ Brand zone opt-ins ≥ 2 times
✓ D7 retention = true
✓ No safety flags (reports, bans)
System state: User added to qualitative_intent cohort. Flag in database, but no UX change yet.
Phase 3: Conversion Offer (Non-Coercive UI)
User sees one of these opt-in triggers (in order of non-intrusiveness):
Option A: Passive Suggestion (Lowest friction)
•	User completes a mission or enters Brand Zone
•	Light notification: "You seem interested in [partner]. View showroom?"
•	CTA is one-click, reversible (user can dismiss)
•	If dismissed, don't re-show for 7 days
Option B: Contextual Prompt (Medium friction)
•	User visits Brand Zone for 3rd time
•	Floating suggestion card at edge of screen (not center)
•	"Ready to learn more? See how [partner] helps communities like this."
•	User can close card or click; no persistence
Option C: Admin Recommendation (Community-driven)
•	Community leader manually recommends showroom to active members
•	Message: "[Leader] thought you'd like to learn about [partner]"
•	Branded as community recommendation, not platform push
•	User can accept/dismiss
4.3 Transition Safeguards
Guardrail 1: Frequency Capping
Max showroom offers per user per month: 3
If user dismisses 2x, wait 14 days before suggesting again
If user joins showroom, don't suggest again for 30 days (let them decide on their own)
Guardrail 2: Decay & Respect
User not in "Qualitative" cohort?
→ No showroom offers shown
→ User remains in engagement-only experience
User leaves community or becomes inactive (3+ days no activity)?
→ Intent signals decay after 7d inactivity
→ User reverts to "Exploratory" or "Latent"
Guardrail 3: Explicit Opt-Out
User can opt out of all conversion offers in profile settings
Setting: "I'm here for community engagement only"
System respects this; no showroom suggestions shown
Guardrail 4: Minors Protection
User age < 18?
→ No conversion offers shown (per 20_ADULT_BY_DESIGN_SPEC.md)
→ No lead capture or sales engagement
→ Engagement-only experience

Part 5: Ethical Guardrails & Compliance
5.1 No-Go Patterns (Forbidden by Design)
Pattern	Why No-Go	System Implementation
Individual Profiling	Violates privacy, enables manipulation	All user data aggregated to cohort level; never expose individual scores
Fake Social Proof	Damages trust; unethical	No simulated user activity; AI bots labeled as AI
Urgency Manipulation	Exploits vulnerability	No countdown timers, limited-time offers, or pressure language
Dark Patterns	LGPD violation	No difficult opt-out, no disguised links, no pre-checked boxes
Behavioral Addiction Loops	Damages community health	Missions designed for competence (not compulsion); no streak punishments
Minors Targeting	Illegal + unethical	Age gate enforced; no conversion offers for age < 18

5.2 Ethical Decision Framework (Per Feature)
Before deploying any showroom variant or bot prompt:
Question 1: Transparency
•	Can you explain this rule to a user and they understand it?
•	If answer is no → Don't deploy
Question 2: Reversibility
•	Can a user opt out or go back?
•	If answer is no → Don't deploy
Question 3: Autonomy
•	Is the user making a real choice, or are you nudging them?
•	If nudging → Ensure nudge is in their interest, not yours
Question 4: Harm
•	Could this damage the community or user wellbeing?
•	If answer is maybe → Run safety review
5.3 Audit & Compliance
Monthly Audit: Showroom Variants
SELECT
variant_id,
bot_mode,
hard_sell_enabled,
data_collection_intensity,
avg_lead_quality_score,
form_abandon_rate,
user_feedback_sentiment
FROM showroombottests
WHERE end_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
AND status = 'completed'
ORDER BY avg_lead_quality_score DESC;
-- Audit rule: If hard_sell_enabled = true and form_abandon_rate > 50%,
-- flag for review. May indicate coercive language.
Quarterly Review: Cohort Readiness Criteria
1.	Verify that readiness criteria remain unbiased
o	No demographic proxies (e.g., "users in X zone are always ready")
o	No correlations with minors or vulnerable groups
2.	Check for drift in application
o	Are some communities repeatedly offered showrooms vs. others?
o	Is there geographic or leader-based bias?
3.	Review user feedback
o	Survey: "Did you feel pressured to enter showroom?"
o	Target: <5% users report pressure
4.	Update criteria if necessary

Conclusion
Your two-pillar architecture is scientifically sound and ethically defensible. By:
1.	Pillar 1: Using Graph Theory and behavioral science to map social density and identify high-potential communities (not individuals)
2.	Pillar 2: Designing AI-driven showrooms with automated feedback loops that respect user autonomy
3.	The Bridge: Creating non-coercive transition mechanics based on explicit opt-in and behavioral readiness
You create a sustainable, defensible SaaS model that prioritizes user trust and community health while enabling qualified lead generation.
The key is aggregation over profiling, transparency over manipulation, and autonomy over coercion. This approach is harder to scale fast, but it builds lasting competitive advantage through trust and compliance.

Next Steps
1.	Refine acceptance criteria for Tier 1 readiness (adjust ReadinessScore formula based on data)
2.	Design bot opening prompt (test 3–5 variants for clarity and intent capture)
3.	Define showroom layouts (3 variants: educational, consultative, sales-oriented)
4.	Set up monitoring dashboards before any conversions go live
5.	Run closed-loop pilot (one community, manually-gated showroom, 2-week iteration)
6.	Monthly ethical review (ensure no drift toward manipulation)

Questions to Address in Next Sprint:
•	What are your target lead quality thresholds? (What defines a "good lead" for your use case?)
•	How will you handle geographic or vertical variation? (Different showrooms for different partner types?)
•	Do you have a preferred CRM/sales tool for lead routing? (Impacts bot handoff and data flow)
•	What is your tolerance for false positives? (Users offered showroom who aren't ready vs. false negatives who are ready but not offered)
